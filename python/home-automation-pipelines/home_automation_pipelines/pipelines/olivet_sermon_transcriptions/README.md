See hello-world-whisper for where I did this at first

I don't need to necessarily maintain all the webscraping stuff - I'll just start doing them with the sermons I'm uploading

Process

1. Sermon uploaded to Raw Upload
2. I could have a script run on schedule or figure out an even thing eventually to pull the file over WebDAV and run whisper then upload somewhere with a unique name
3. Match name to the sermon `S - <Book> <Chapter> <Verses>`
