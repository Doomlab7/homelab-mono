# YNAB README

After having cleaned up the existing budget I'm focusing on 2022 onwards

1. CEFCU should be totally up to date
2. Chase I will plan to pull whatever is relevant, and it only goes back 25 months
3. Foxcom?
4. Capital one?

For CEFCU I want to run `cefcu2_account.py` which considered the category mapping and drops a file that can directly be imported into YNAB
