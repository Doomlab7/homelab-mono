# Home Automation Pipelines

This hasn't even been pushed to a remote repo

What's in here?

1. My attempt at ynab automation... very difficult even though it sounds simple
2. some old stuff for olivet, I think that's all in olivet-davinci-resolve-automation... probably worth bringing that into what I'll use as my pipelines repo after I decide on a framework... airflow or prefect... something with a server
