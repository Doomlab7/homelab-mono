# üè† Monitoring Visibility

This stack provides glances and netdata

My more comprehensive monitoring stack is in my [monitoring repo](https://github.com/Doomlab7/homelab-monitoring)

I need to consolidate these two stacks but on ghost I'm using Ansible-NAS stats stack right now still since it's better than what I've built yet

This is more or less copied to babyblue for the time being just to track what's deployed where - but the networks and traefik config are different
