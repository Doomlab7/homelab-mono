# Olivet Vocal Remover

This is deployed from the repo with changes in it for volume mounting code changes right on ghost

It's at ~/projects/personal/vocal-remover on ghost

and it's the docker compose... there's a lot in there, but just docker compose up from there is fine because there's some local changes to volume mount in
