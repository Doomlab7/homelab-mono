# Restic Backup with Docker Compose

This setup uses `restic` within a Docker container to provide versioned, encrypted, and deduplicated backups of your important directories to a NAS or other storage location.

> This was the first setup of my restic backup, but I will try to simplify away from compose so that we can use temporal for this in a more natural way

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## 1. Configuration

This setup connects to your NAS via SFTP (SSH). You will need to configure the connection details and generate a dedicated SSH key for security.

### a. Prepare Your SSH Key

1. **Identify or Generate an SSH Key:** You can use an existing SSH key or generate a new one specifically for backups. Make sure the public key is added to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file for the appropriate user on your **NAS**.

2. **Copy the Private Key:** Copy the private key you want to use into the local `.ssh` directory and name it `id_rsa`. This key will be used by the container to connect to your NAS.

   ```bash
   # Example using an existing key
   cp /path/to/your/private_key /home/nic/projects/personal/homelab-mono/dataops/systemd/restic-docker-compose/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

3. **Set Permissions:** SSH requires that the private key file has strict permissions. Set them now.

   ```bash
   chmod 600 /home/nic/projects/personal/homelab-mono/dataops/systemd/restic-docker-compose/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

### b. Create and Configure Environment Files

1. **Create a `.env` file:** Copy the `.env.example` to `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit `.env`:** Open the `.env` file and set the following variables:

   - `BACKUP_SOURCE`: The absolute path to the directory you want to back up (e.g., `/home/nic`).
   - `SFTP_USER`: The username for SSH access to your NAS.
   - `SFTP_HOST`: The IP address or hostname of your NAS.
   - `SFTP_PATH`: The absolute path on the NAS where the backup repository will be stored (e.g., `/volume1/backups/restic`).
   - `HOST_RESTIC_PASSWORD_FILE`: The path to the file containing your restic repository password (see next step).

3. **Create the Restic Password File:**

   ```bash
   # Use a strong, unique password
   echo "your-super-secret-password" > /home/nic/projects/personal/homelab-mono/dataops/systemd/restic-docker-compose/.restic-password
   # Set permissions to be safe
   chmod 600 /home/nic/projects/personal/homelab-mono/dataops/systemd/restic-docker-compose/.restic-password
   ```

   Ensure the `RESTIC_PASSWORD_FILE` variable in your `.env` file points to this file.

## 2. Initial Setup

With your configuration in place, you need to initialize the `restic` repository on your NAS. This only needs to be done once. The command constructs the repository path from your `.env` variables.

```bash
docker compose run --rm --entrypoint restic backup init -r sftp:${SFTP_USER}@${SFTP_HOST}:${SFTP_PATH}
```

## 2. Automation with systemd

This setup includes `systemd` unit files to automate your backups. This is the recommended way to run scheduled jobs on a modern Linux system.

### a. Installation

1. **Copy the Unit Files**: Copy the provided `.service` and `.timer` files to your systemd user directory.

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
   cp /home/nic/projects/personal/homelab-mono/dataops/systemd/restic-docker-compose/systemd/nas-backup.* ~/.config/systemd/user/
   ```

2. **Reload the systemd Daemon**: Tell systemd to pick up the new files.

   ```bash
   systemctl --user daemon-reload
   ```

3. **Enable and Start the Timer**: This command enables the timer to start automatically on boot and starts it right away.

   ```bash
   systemctl --user enable --now nas-backup.timer
   ```

### b. Managing the Backup Job

- **Check Timer Status**: To see when the next backup is scheduled to run, use:

  ```bash
  systemctl --user list-timers
  ```

- **View Logs**: To see the logs from the last backup run, use the `journalctl` command:

  ```bash
  journalctl --user -u nas-backup.service
  ```

- **Run a Manual Backup**: If you want to trigger a backup manually right now, you can start the service directly:

  ```bash
  systemctl --user start nas-backup.service
  ```

## 3. Automated Backup & Prune

This setup is now automated. Running the `backup` service will perform two actions in sequence:

1. **Backup**: It backs up the `BACKUP_SOURCE` directory.
2. **Prune**: It applies a retention policy to historical snapshots (keeps the last 7 daily, 4 weekly, and 6 monthly) and deletes any data that is no longer needed.

To run the automated process, simply execute:

```bash
docker compose run --rm backup
```

## 4. Manual Operations

### Using Justfile Recipes (Recommended)

This project includes convenient justfile recipes for common restic operations. These recipes can be executed from the project root directory, making it easy to manage your backups:

```bash
# List all snapshots
just restic-snapshots

# Check repository integrity
just restic-check

# List files in the latest snapshot
just restic-ls

# List files in a specific snapshot
just restic-ls snapshot_id=73e326a6

# Compare two snapshots
just restic-diff snapshot_id1=latest~1 snapshot_id2=latest

# Show repository stats
just restic-stats

# Restore a specific file for verification
just restic-verify-file file_path="/source/path/to/file"
```

These justfile recipes execute bash scripts located in the `dataops/systemd/restic-docker-compose/scripts` directory, which handle environment variable loading and proper command execution.

### Using Docker Compose Directly

Alternatively, if you need to perform a manual operation directly (like listing snapshots or restoring a file), you can override the entrypoint to run `restic` directly with the `--entrypoint` flag:

#### Listing Snapshots

To see all the snapshots in your repository:

```bash
docker compose run --rm --entrypoint restic backup snapshots -r sftp:${SFTP_USER}@${SFTP_HOST}:${SFTP_PATH}
```

### Restoring Files

To restore a file or directory from a backup, you need the snapshot ID (from the `snapshots` command). To restore the latest snapshot:

```bash
# Create a directory to restore to
- mkdir -p /tmp/restore

# Restore the latest snapshot to /tmp/restore
docker compose run --rm -v /tmp/restore:/restore_target backup restore latest --target /restore_target -r sftp:${SFTP_USER}@${SFTP_HOST}:${SFTP_PATH}
```

To restore a specific file from the latest snapshot:

```bash
docker compose run --rm -v /tmp/restore:/restore_target backup restore latest --target /restore_target --path "/source/path/to/your/file" -r sftp:${SFTP_USER}@${SFTP_HOST}:${SFTP_PATH}
```

### Comparing Snapshots (Diff)

To see the exact changes between any two snapshots, you can use the `diff` command. You will need the IDs of the two snapshots you want to compare, which you can get from the `snapshots` command.

```bash
# Compare snapshot-ID-1 with snapshot-ID-2
docker compose run --rm backup diff <snapshot-ID-1> <snapshot-ID-2> -r sftp:${SFTP_USER}@${SFTP_HOST}:${SFTP_PATH}
```

### Verifying Your Backup

It's important to be confident that your backups are working correctly. Here are a few commands to verify the integrity and content of your repository.

**1. Check Repository Integrity**

The `check` command scans the repository for internal errors and ensures all data is correctly stored and readable.

```bash
docker compose run --rm backup check -r sftp:${SFTP_USER}@${SFTP_HOST}:${SFTP_PATH}
```

**2. List Files in a Snapshot**

You can list all the files in your latest backup to ensure everything you intended to back up is there.

```bash
docker compose run --rm backup ls latest -r sftp:${SFTP_USER}@${SFTP_HOST}:${SFTP_PATH}
```

**3. Restore a Test File**

The ultimate test is to restore a file. Create a temporary directory and restore a single file to confirm it's readable and correct.

```bash
# Create a temporary directory on your host
mkdir -p /tmp/restore

# Restore a specific file (e.g., your README) to that directory
docker compose run --rm -v /tmp/restore:/restore_target backup restore latest --target /restore_target --path "/source/README.md" -r sftp:${SFTP_USER}@${SFTP_HOST}:${SFTP_PATH}

# Check the restored file on your host
cat /tmp/restore/source/README.md
```

### Forgetting and Pruning Old Snapshots

To manage your backup history (e.g., keep the last 7 daily, 4 weekly, and 6 monthly snapshots):

```bash
docker compose run --rm backup forget --keep-daily 7 --keep-weekly 4 --keep-monthly 6 --prune -r sftp:${SFTP_USER}@${SFTP_HOST}:${SFTP_PATH}
```

## 4. Automation (Optional)

You can automate your backups using a `cron` job or a `systemd` timer on your host machine to run the backup command periodically.

Example `cron` job to run a backup every day at 2 AM:

```cron
0 2 * * * cd /home/nic/projects/personal/homelab-mono/dataops/systemd/restic-docker-compose && /usr/bin/docker compose run --rm backup backup /source -r sftp:${SFTP_USER}@${SFTP_HOST}:${SFTP_PATH} >> /var/log/restic-backup.log 2>&1
```
